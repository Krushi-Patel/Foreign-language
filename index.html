	<h2>Introduction on Languages:-</h2>
	<p>A foreign language is a language not commonly spoken in the country of the speaker. However, there must be a defined distinction between foreign language and second language. The advantages of learning foreign languages are mushrooming as the world becomes increasingly globalized and bilingualism is now perhaps the most useful real world skill to ever exist, rather than just being a nifty party trick. If you’re thinking about making the effort to learn a foreign language rather than expecting the world to accommodate your monolingualism, you are a rare breed indeed. Blossoming into the impressive polyglot you aspire to be is 100% feasible with the right approach and mindset.Foreign language study is all about learning how to truly communicate and connect with others—an incredibly important life skill that can only be cultivated by interacting with people. When you master a foreign language, you can exercise your new superhuman power of being able to understand what someone is saying, recall the proper vocab and grammar, put that vocab and grammar into the proper context, and reply back—all on the spot and in a timely manner. You’ve connected. And that is what it’s all about. Some of the foreign languages:-</p>
	<ul>
		<li>French</li>
		<li>German</li>
		<li>Chinese</li>
		<li>Japanese</li>
		<li>Spanish</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Most widely spoken Foreign Languages:-</h2>
		<p>The top 4 foreign languages with the most speakers (Natives and Non-Natives) are Mandarin Chinese, Spanish, Arabic, and French.I have not considered Hindi and English since both are official languages of the Government of India. There is no national language, as declared by the Constitution of India.German and Japanese are also popular in India since Germany, and Japan’s economy is highly developed and offer lots of career possibilities in India and abroad.Over the last few years, the demand for Portuguese, Italian, Korean, and Russian has also grown in India for multiple reasons.</p>

	<h2>More about languages:-</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>French(Français):</li>
		<p>French is the most popular foreign language to learn in India.Since French is part of most School and College curriculum, More than 1 lakh students study French in Delhi / NCR only. Add other Indian cities, and the number will be staggering high.French is also one of the best foreign languages to learn for jobs in corporate sectors in India.Many multinational companies use French as their working language in a wide range of industries. It includes fashion, education, banking and finance, export and import, traveling, retailing, education, automotive, luxury goods, aeronautics, etc.Learning French can be a career asset in several sectors.</p>

		<li>German(Deutsch):</li>
		<p>Germany offers cheaper education as compared to other European countries, hence foreign language courses teaching German help students who are planning to study abroad.Even though German is not widely spoken, such as French, Spanish, Arabic, or Chinese.It is still the second most popular foreign language in India after French.The five main reasons:-<br>
    i) The most spoken mother tongue in Europe. It is the official language in Germany, Austria, Switzerland, and more.<br> 
    ii) Germany is an economic powerhouse. And the ability to speak German offers plenty of job opportunities in many big German companies such as Volkswagen, BASF, Daimler, BMW, Bosch, Siemens, etc. German is a top choice in the field of Science, Engineering, Automobile, etc.<br>
    iii) The German language is part of an academic curriculum in more than 500 Schools and Colleges in India, including more than 250 Kendriya Vidyalayas alone.<br>
    iv) “First Move advantage” – Like the French, the German government promoted German in India several decades back. In 1957, the first “Max Mueller Bhavan” was inaugurated in Kolkata. The first German lessons in India were imparted in Pune and Mumbai in 1914 (more than a century back).<br>
    v) Germany’s universities have an excellent international reputation and among the best in the world. Thanks to a wide array of scholarships, German proficiency plays a crucial role if you plan to go to Germany or Austria for higher studies.</p>

		<li>Spanish (Español):</li>
		<p>With 20 Spanish-speaking countries, It is one of the most widely spoken languages globally.The Spanish language is the third most popular foreign language to learn after French & German.There are multiple reasons to learn Spanish.Numerous career paths like Travel and Tourism, journalism, foreign service, and international business exist.You can also find jobs in BPO, translation, interpretation, language teaching, for which proficiency in spoken and written Spanish can be a valuable asset.There is a growing business relationship between India and Hispanic countries, especially South and Central America. Besides, in the USA, it is the second most spoken language.The popularity of Spanish Football, Music, and Movies are a few more reasons people opt for Spanish courses in India.</p>

		<li>Japanese(日本語 / Nihongo):</li>
		<p>Japanese operates in the Indian market and they are reluctant to speak English or any other language, which creates the nedd for Japanese translators and interpreters.Demand for the Japanese language is high due to growing India-Japan relations and Japanese companies expanding Indian operations.Japan is synonymous with high quality and technologically advanced products.Japanese is the most popular choice among East Asian languages in India.Since Japanese has a reputation for being difficult to learn, there is less competition for job positions with Japanese-speaking applicants.Suppose you’re looking for a foreign language that is highly paid in India. In that case, Japanese is the language that gets you paid the most in India and abroad.The career Scope of Japanese is astonishing if you accomplish a high level of proficiency like JLPT N2.</p>

		<li>Mandarin Chinese (普通话 / Pǔtōnghuà):</li>
		<p>More than a billion people speak Mandarin Chinese across the world.The 21st century belongs to China, and knowing the Chinese language will allow you to compete effectively in the global economy of the future.China has become an enormous market. International businesses and companies are looking for people who can talk in Chinese and operate successfully in China’s cultural context.Since very few people speak Chinese in India, proficiency in Chinese may give you an edge when competing for a vital position in any firm.Beyond the five most popular foreign languages in India, the following five other useful ones are Portuguese, Russian, Italian, Arabic, and Korean</p>

	<h2>Which foreign language to choose?</h2>
	<p>Some languages are valuable because they are challenging to learn. The number of people proficient in these languages is very low.Other languages are fueled by purposes like emigration to a particular country, Diplomatic reason, learning for the hobby, or looking for job opportunities in a specific booming industry or nation.Many other foreign languages are less taught languages for varied reasons.Asian languages such as Turkish, Persian, Bahasa Indonesia, Tibetan, Mongolian are some examples.Plus, Eastern European languages like Bulgarian, Croatian, Czech, Romanian, Polish, Hungarian, Central European like Dutch, Catalan, African Swahili, and Scandinavian also fall in a similar category.Nordic languages like Danish, Swedish, and Norwegian are the most natural tongues for English speakers to learn.Spanish, Italian, and Portuguese are the most straightforward language to acquire for Indians if we compare them with French, German, or Russian.According to the FSI study, Mandarin Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Arabic are some of the hardest languages to master.Spanish is the best choice if you explore an uncomplicated international language to study with an excellent career scope.If your Job or Business tends to require a knowledge of any specific language that is not popular, that would be a completely different ball game.Otherwise, the practical use and benefits you get out of are not as high as French, Spanish, German, Japanese, or Chinese.All languages matter!Therefore, always choose the language as per your career goal or interest and not going with the most popular and obvious ones. You will never regret learning a foreign language.Many learn a language for the sake of learning it. In that case, people search for the easiest language to learn.It is one of the main reasons why most people fail to learn a language.Language learning takes time. I’m not talking about weeks or months but several years.Choosing the right foreign language is very important. It would be challenging to change the language midway.</p>
